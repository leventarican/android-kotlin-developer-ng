# Navigation example
* __not__ Map Navigation
* navigate throught the app (screens)
* in this example we will have a single _activity_ (architecture)
    * each screen is build using a UI component known as _fragment_

## Navigation Patterns
* in the _action bar_ we can find the _navigation drawer_, _app button_ and _overflow menu_
    * _app button_ is similar to the _system back button_
